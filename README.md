ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Donza3D

    - Iâ€™m involved in crafts of all types including jewelry making, metalsmithing & 3D construction
    - Iâ€™m a retired computer professional who loves to learn new things & am currently learning to 
        use my new embroidery machine to be able to digitize my own designs
    - I really enjoy learning new software & being involved in beta-testing!
    - I am a very proud "crazy cat & horse lady" living in Aiken SC
